# Signal - A Quick Safety Alert App

Signal is a simple app designed to quickly alert trusted contacts if you feel unsafe. It sends a pre-set message and your location to your chosen contacts with minimal effort.

## Features
- **Add Trusted Contacts:** Select trusted contacts directly from your mobile's contact list.
- **Custom Emergency Message:** Create a personalized emergency or safety alert message.
- **Quick Alerts:** Send your custom message along with your location (via a Google Maps URL) to trusted contacts through SMS.

## To Do
- **Automated SMS Sending:** Currently, clicking Send Alert opens the SMS app, requiring the user to manually send the message. This issue will be addressed once [react-native-mobile-sms's dependency issue](https://github.com/hack5hu/react-native-mobile-sms/issues/2) is fixed, or an alternative supported package becomes available.
